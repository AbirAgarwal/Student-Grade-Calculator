# Student-Grade-Calculator
First I am giving a variable totalmarks to to save the value for it 
next then I am using the for loop to get marks input for subjects one by one and I am using int(input()) to get only integer values then I am obtaining average marks by dividing the totalmarks by 5 then I am printing total marks and average marks then I am using if statement to ceck the average marks and give grade and I am using elif so that if a value is true for if statement and the next elif statement then it doesnot have to print two grades.
You can copy the code and paste it in any python compiler and use it
