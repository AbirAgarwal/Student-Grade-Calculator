# Student-Grade-Calculator
First I am giving a variable totalmarks to to save the value for it 
next I am using for loop to get marks input for subjects one by one
I am giving int(input()) to get only integer values
I am obtainin average marks by dividing the totalmarks by 5
then I am printing total marks and average marks
then I am using if statement to ceck the average marks and give grade 
I am using elif so that if a value is true for if statement and the next elif statement then it doesnot have to print two grades
